## Question 1

Take a look at the file labeled `data/phase0.txt`. Why might we have missing values or values that state "NO DATA" in this dataset? While we are currently ignoring these values, what might be the risk of filtering these values out?

[Answer here]
My initial thoughts on why we might have missing values and some that state "No data" is because they couldve been left out intentitionally to not skew the original data set. THe risk with filtering them out is that it could hold vital information once domain context is provided.

## Question 2

During sleep, we expect maximum heart rate of a phase to be **lower** than the maximum heart rate of all other phases. Observe the visualizations and descriptive statistics that you've calculated. Using these findings, in which phase does sleep occur? Mention numerical details that back your findings.

[Answer here]
From my visual analysis, it appears that the sleep state seem to be reached throughout the later phase of the day. Specifally speaking, the time range falls between the numbers of 40 and 60 on the x-axis, within the figure labeled HeartyVibes.

## Question 3

During exercise, we expect the maximum heart rate of a phase to be **higher** the maximum heart rate of all other phases. Observe the visualizations and descriptive statistics that you've calculated. Using these findings, in which phase(s) does exercise occur? Mention numerical details that back your findings.

[Answer here]
Based on the quantitative data within the HeartyVibes visualization, we could reasonably assume that the maximum heart rate peaks early in the day between 0 to 10 on the x-axis, labeled as time of day.

## Question 4

During regular periods of awake activity, we expect the average heart rate of a phase to be relatively **lower** than the average heart rate of other phases, but we also expect standard deviation to be **higher**. In which phase do we notice this trend?

[Answer here]
If i understand this question correctly, I would say this "awake" phase occurs throughout the middle portion of the HeartyVibes figure listed between 20 and 40 of the x-axis within the 1st and 2nd standard deviation.
